Essentially, I will use this as a platform to talk about things I enjoy and want to talk about more. I don't expect many people to read it or care but I want to get my thoughts and ideas out there regardless.

This blog is made using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) as well as the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) theme for [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I did a bit of googling and felt this theme looked good, seemed fairly simple, and had some nice features like categories and tags. I have never used jekyll or ruby before so it was a bit difficult setting up jekyll, although it was definitely worth it. Ruby seems very sensitive to installation environment and whether it's installed locally or system-wide. Thankfully rbenv worked for me and solved the issues I was having. I can now easily test how things look on the site locally before pushing changes to github, where it will make the site using github actions. 

The content of the blog will likely be a bit eclectic, as it is just me typing about whatever insterests me in the moment. There will likely be stints where I post only a little or where I post a lot. Currently I imagine this blog being mostly used to talk about the 3ds, gaming in general, and my experience with linux. Who knows what else might be included. 

I also might make some tutorials for things, mostly 3ds related, if I feel tutorials elsewhere are lacking, or if I just feel like it doesn't fit in the [3ds wiki](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Main_Page). While I'm not staff there or anything I do contribute. However, the guides there are designed to be simple step by step guides. Guides here will likely be more technical while still trying to give people the tools needed to understand how to apply the techniques I give, so you might need to give a bit of effort to follow them. I feel this is important to empowering users to actually understand their devices and how to address issues, instead of having them continuously ask for help at the slightest mistep or inconvenience. It is a complex issue of course, but I wanted to address it a bit.

I may figure out how to allow comments on these posts in the future. Until then, the noreply email should suffice. You can also contact me through discord, username is just `chalenged`.
