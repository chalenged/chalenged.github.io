description: A bit of yapping about why chromebooks are bad, and alternatives
---

Chromebooks came out in 2011as a budget laptop option. They run Google's proprietary ChromeOS and have very minimal hardware, generally being passively-cooled. This allows them to be very cheap, as they don't have to spend money on Windows liscenses, fans, or even being remotely modular, with soldered-on ram and NAND flashes for storage. Schools and businesses often made deals to buy them for their students and employees, so many people have used them (even if they didn't want to). 

If you're one of those people you know how dreadful doing anything on these machines can be. They're very slow to do even simple things, and have limited functionality due to being on ChromeOS instead of a more proper operating system. Aditionally not all chromebooks even have the capability to run android apps! Truly awful.

While the price might seem appealing, especially for a college student, there are better options. Used and refurbished laptops will cost around the same price as a new chromebook, and even somewhat older laptops will be much better to use than a chromebook, while having a proper operating system, and you aren't locked to ChromeOS, you can just install linux. 

Now, if you have a chromebook there might be something you can do to make it more usable; Install linux! [Chrultrabook](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/) has some great information on installing a proper linux operating system on your chromebook. With [submarine](https://developer.fyralabs.com/submarine) you can make any chromebook run a proper linux installation instead of ChromeOS. There's also the option to flash the firmware if you have an older chromebook. The UEFI boot rom option gives you a standard UEFI, which is quite nice and makes installation much easier.

I have an Asus C523N chromebook that I installed Arch Linux with KDE Plasma on, and it's much better than it was before. Browsing is faster, I can have a real document writer program instead of just Google Docs, and surprisingly the audio works just fine after using the script. If you have a chromebook I highly recommend checking out Chrultrabook and getting it set up. It might be a bit of work to get set up but it made it actually usable instead of a giant paperweight.

All of this said, I still would recommend against getting a chromebook, even pre-owned, as you could spend just a little more and get a decent pre-owned laptop. I looked just a little and saw quite a few good deals on decent laptops for less than $100 USD. Putting linux on a newer one with submarine, while possible and probably worth it if you already have a chromebook, is still much more effort than on a regular laptop as well as being a worse experience. A lot of chromebooks have really bad processors (intel celeron dual core at 1.1ghz), as well as atrocious keyboard layouts. The meta (windows/command) key is where capslock normally is, there's no F keys (There's a script to make the top keys be F keys but there's not enough for all 12), and it's missing Delete, Home, and really anything that could be useful.

Unfortunately a lot of chromebooks end up being E-Waste pretty quick because of how low their specs and general desireability are. If you or someone you know needs a laptop, consider buying a used or refurbished one instead of a chromebook. And if you have a chromebook, consider installing linux on it and making it a (more) usable device.
